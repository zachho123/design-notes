# General Tips
- Use less borders (can try box-shadow to make an element pop / give depth)
- Try several different layout options
- Don't be afraid to enlarge images to overlap other elements
- If you have a header that breaks up nicely, can add brand color to half of it to highlight key words / incorporate brand color further
- If buttons have rounded corners, think about making other clickable items also have rounded corners, keeps consistency and gives subtle visual queue

## Hero Section
The first section of a site, often includes:
- Headline
- Sub-headline
- Image or graphic of some type
- Call to action
