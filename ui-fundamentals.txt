Color
=======
* Be aware of target demographic, colors can mean different things to different groups
- general color psychology:
  - black: luxury, sophistication, elegance
  - white:
  - red: error
  - yellow: happy
  - orange:
  - green: wealth, nature, growth, success
  - blue: intelligence
  - purple:
- in general, lighter elements feel closer and darker elements feel further away
- to make something feel inset on a light background, give it an off-white color (be careful not to make it look like a disabled state)
- gray text looks a bit off on a colored background, we want the text to look more like the background color than gray, take HSB picker and add a little saturation of the background color

Alignment
===========
- don't fall into trap of centering everything

===============
Common Issues
===============
- When creating a dark theme (or vice versa), don't just invert the colors
we want to use the same visual queues in both designs, ie: the lightest color
element in the light themed UI, should remain the lightest color element in the
dark themed UI

==============
General Tips
==============
- use less borders
- semantics are secondary to hierarchy
- try several different layout options
- don't be afraid to enlarge images to overlap other elements
- use color and weight (not only size), to indicate hierarchy
- if you have a header that breaks up nicely, can add brand color to half of it to highlight key words / incorporate brand color further
- if buttons have rounded corners, think about making other clickable items also have rounded corners, keeps consistency and gives subtle visual queue
- you don't need to blow up the size of every title, sometimes proximity to other elements alone is enough (ie: video title next to video)
