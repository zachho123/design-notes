# Visual Hierarchy

## General

- Semantics are secondary to hierarchy
- Use color and weight (not only size), to indicate hierarchy
- You don't need to blow up the size of every title, sometimes proximity to other elements alone is enough (ie: video title next to video)

## Hierarchy and Color

- De-emphasize text with lighter color (less contrast) ie: for sub-headlines or body text vs headers / titles.
