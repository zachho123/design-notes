# UI Design Notes

## UI Design Fundamentals
1. Color
2. Contrast
3. Whitespace
4. Typography
5. Alignment
6. Visual Hierarchy
7. Scale
8. ** Consistency **

### Hero Section
The first section of a site, often includes:
* Headline
* Sub-headline
* Img / Asset
* Call to action

## Color

* be aware of target demographic, different colors can mean different things to different groups
* in general, lighter elements feel closer and darker elements feel fruther away
* to make something feel inset on a light background, give it an off-white color (be careful not to make it look like a disabled state)
* gray text looks off on a colored background, we want the text to look more like the background color than gray, take HSB picker and add a little saturation of the background color

### General Color Psychology:
* black: luxury, sophistication, elegance
* white: 
* red: error
* yellow: happy
* orange:
* green: wealth, nature, growth, success
* blue: intelligence
* purple:

## Fonts
* more serious tone : serif
* more relaxed : sans-serif
* more playful : rounded

## Alignment
* don't fall into trap of centering everything

## Common Issues
* when creating a light/dark theme, don't just invert the colors. we want the same visual queues in both designs, ie: the lighest colored element in the light themed UI, should remain the lightest color element in the dark themed UI

## General Tips
* use less borders
* semantics are secondary to hierarchy
* try several different layout options
* don't be afraid to enlarge images to overlap other elements
* use color and weight (not only size), to indicate hierarchy
* if you have a header that breaks up nicely, can add brand color to half of it to highlight key words / incorporate brand color further
* if buttons have rounded corners, think about making other clickable items also have rounded corners, keeps consistency and gives subtle visual queue
* you don't need to blow up the size of every title, sometimes proximity to other elements alone is enough (ie: video title next to video)
