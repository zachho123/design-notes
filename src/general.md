# General Tips

- Use less borders
- Try several different layout options
- If you have a header that breaks up nicely, can add brand color to half of it to highlight key words / incorporate brand color further
- If buttons have rounded corners, think about making other clickable items also have rounded corners, keeps consistency and gives subtle visual queue

## Hero Section

The first section of a site, often includes:
- Headline
- Sub-headline
- Image or graphic of some type
- Call to action

## Adding Depth - Counteracting "Flat" Design

- Overlapping elements/sections/photos with each other can create depth and a more interesting look

### Shadows

- Box-shadows can be used to make an element pop/give it distinction from it's surroundings/background without adding a hard border
- The larger the shadow, the closer the element will feel to the user
  - Steve Schoger approach, 4-5 shadows
     - shadow-xs: buttons, inputs
     - shadow-s: dropdown menus, small panels
     - shadow-m: large panels
     - shadow-l: large modals
- Shadows have 2 parts:
    - ambient light: tight, dark shadow, below
    - direct light: longer, lighter shadow
