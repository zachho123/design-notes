# Scale

## Icons
- Don't blow icons beyond their intended size, ~40 pixel size should be good

## Inputs
- When thinking about input length, we want to create an expectation of input length based on the length (don't have excessively long input fields for short things/dropdowns, consider rearranging to put inputs on single line)
- Give inputs room to breath (height of 40-48px)
