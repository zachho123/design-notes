# Alignment

## General
- Don't fall into trap of centering everything
- Always align with readability in mind
  - Centering is better suited for headlines and short bits of text
  - Left alignment is much more readable, use for larger chunks of text
  - Some values like dates and dollar amounts are better right aligned, so that decimals and punctuation are aligned

## Tricks

### Tabular Numbers

This css property will make fonts act like monospace

```css
font-feature-settings: "tnum"
```
