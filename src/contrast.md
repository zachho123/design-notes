# Contrast

## General
- Give text consistent contrast
- Gray text looks off on a colored background
  - We want the text to look more like the background color than gray
  - Take HSB picker and add a little saturation of the background color
- Try to avoid using straight black/white text on colored backgrounds, instead saturate the black/white with a bit of the background hue

## Inputs
- To give white inputs on a white background a little more distinction, give the inputs an off-white background color (be careful not to make the inputs look disabled)
