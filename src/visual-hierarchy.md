# Visual Hierarchy

## General

- Semantics are secondary to hierarchy
- Use color and weight (not only size), to indicate hierarchy
- You don't need to blow up the size of every title, sometimes proximity to other elements alone is enough (ie: video title next to video)
- Usually easier to use a lighter background with darker text to achieve higher contrast ratios for better readability.

## Hierarchy and Color

- De-emphasize text with lighter color (less contrast) ie: for sub-headlines or body text vs headers / titles.
- Use subtle off-whites to break up sections rather than borders

### Alternate Backgrounds

Break up sections of webpage by rotating different background colors (ex: white, light gray, dark gray, brand color)

## Balance weight and contrast

Example: You are using solid bold icons next to related text (for context/scanability). However, even though the text and icon are the same color, the icon seems a lot darker (due to it's higher weight). To counterbalance this, and keep the icon and related text on the same level of the visual hierarchy, give the icon a lighter color.

- TLDR; you can make heavier elements feel lighter via color, without changing the weight

## Tables

Headings more often than not function more like labels (they are there to support the actual content). This means that they shouldn't be super big and bold (hence stealing attention away from actual content).

- A good approach would be a smaller font-size + lighter color, but can use all-caps/bold weight for emphasis
